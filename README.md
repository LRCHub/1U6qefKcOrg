```lrc
[00:00.59] I spend my hours doing alchemy
[00:03.87] I mix my yellows and my blues to make a shade of green
[00:07.09] Prosaic practice of depravity
[00:09.87] Suspending innocents above their disbelief
[00:30.87] 
[00:12.46] I wish that I could paint a pretty picture onto everything
[00:16.19] And leave a mark upon the world that felt like anything
[00:18.84] But maybe that's the essence of an artist and their legacy
[00:23.13] Just chasing down a sense of infamy
[00:40.63] 
[00:26.53] Put brush to canvas with a pirouette
[00:29.99] A simple motion makes the consequence intricate
[00:32.58] All the little nothings, and my parapet
[00:38.14] I hope it's something that you don't forget
[00:59.64] 
[00:42.46] Cadmium red is the ground beneath
[00:45.55] Cadmium orange, everything I see
[00:48.84] Cadmium yellow is the air I breathe
[00:52.01] Cadmium colors painted inside me
[01:08.01] 
[00:55.46] I can make autumn from a single leaf
[00:58.62] Steal a fine picture like a first class thief
[01:01.78] Make the water work like you won't believe
[01:05.13] Find a new world that can set you free
[01:08.38] How could anybody ever live like me?
[01:26.38] 
[01:12.01] I spend my hours doing alchemy
[01:15.24] I make a life refining zinc inside the smeltery
[01:18.52] It's not exactly where I want to be
[01:21.01] But wanting doesn't matter when there's mouths to feed
[01:48.01] 
[01:23.96] I wish that I could paint a pretty picture of a fantasy
[01:27.46] And turn a feeling to a living for my family
[01:30.26] Instead, I'll make the metals in the pigments in my reverie
[01:34.41] And maybe that can be enough for me
[01:51.91] 
[01:37.67] Oh, isn't it funny, facing destiny?
[01:41.13] It's like a knife inside, twisting my arteries
[01:44.20] God, I want for nothing but identity
[01:49.44] (I think that something might be wrong with me)
[02:12.94] 
[01:53.83] Cadmium red is the ground beneath
[01:56.98] Cadmium orange, everything I see
[02:00.19] Cadmium yellow is the air I breathe
[02:03.31] Cadmium colors painted inside me
[02:19.31] 
[02:06.62] Ante-grade fever, 101 degrees
[02:09.83] Shatter my body with a gentle breeze
[02:13.02] Damn it, I am real and I have my dreams
[02:16.20] Watch me burn brighter 'til I fail to breathe
[02:19.69] How could anybody ever live like me?
[02:37.69] 
[02:23.77] Baby, do you know what it's like to die?
[02:26.27] To see the sparkle fade from inside your eye
[02:28.45] I can't remember what it's like to feel autonomy
[02:31.11] Can't even feel it in the moments that you left to me
[02:57.61] 
[02:34.38] (I don't wanna leave with a work undone)
[02:36.72] (The paint can barely dry 'fore it fills my lungs)
[02:38.93] I keep a bullet in the chamber, mocking me
[02:41.64] But I don't wanna feel it coming out of me
[02:44.74] I don't want-
[02:51.24] 
[03:11.52] I spend my hours doing alchemy
[03:14.66] I'll mix my yellows and my blues to make a shade of green
[03:17.99] Chasing impossible philosophy
[03:20.94] And hoping that this poison ain't the death of me
[03:45.44] 
[03:27.47] Cadmium red is the ground beneath
[03:30.66] Cadmium orange, everything I see
[03:33.99] Cadmium yellow is the air I breathe
[03:37.13] Cadmium colors painted inside me
[03:53.13] 
[03:40.47] I can make autumn from a single leaf
[03:43.58] Steal a fine picture like a first class thief
[03:46.86] Make the water work like you won't believe
[03:50.06] Find a new world that can set you free
[03:53.31] How could anybody ever live like-?
[04:10.31] 
[03:57.68] Baby, do you know what you wanna hear
[04:00.43] 'Cause you can say the word, make it, oh so clear
[04:03.51] We're all just searching for a sense of solidarity
[04:06.87] To hold each other close and confiscate our destiny
[04:32.37] 
[04:10.66] (No one wants to leave with a work undone)
[04:13.72] (We only need a brush we can pass along)
[04:16.51] I kept a bullet in the chamber for a rainy day
[04:20.15] But what's the point in planning for it anyway?
[04:23.32] I've got too many colors for a shade of grey
[04:26.67] And I can make it Autumn every single day
